      Relative Rotation Graphs®️ visualize the relation between the strength and
      momentum of various assets against a chosen benchmark (i.e. S&P 500 index)
      and themselves. The performance is visualized in four quadrants. Leading
      (green) - the asset is stronger than the benchmark and it's getting
      stronger (positive momentum), Weakening (yellow) - the asset is stronger
      than the benchmark, but it's getting weaker (negative momentum), Lagging
      (red) - the asset is weaker than the benchmark and it's getting weaker,
      Improving (blue) - the asset is weaker than the benchmark, but it's
      getting stronger.
